# Forward kinematics with ROS/Cpp
ROS/cpp project which was focused on making basic communication in ros, calculating forward kinematics for 6DOF robotic manipulator.

to launch the code type "roslaunch Zad1 pub_rrm.launch"
this command will start node with publisher to joint_states, service to provide input for robot, node with forward kinematics and Rviz with simulation
